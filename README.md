# NineSquares
A nine button game where the goal is to activate all the buttons, but each button may also toggle others.

What's already done:

- The command line script runs as intended.
- There's a simple javascript/html web app.

What needs doing:

A Mac GUI
- Ideally, do this first.
- The interface should have a "board" of 9 buttons to play the game, a text field to tell the player if they won, and a button to reset the game board.

A Windows GUI
- Ideally, do this second. 

What else could be done:

A Linux GUI
- To do when a linux os computer is available
