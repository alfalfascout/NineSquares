# NineSquares
A nine button puzzle game where the goal is to activate all the buttons. Each button may also toggle the other buttons.

What's already done:

- The command line script runs as intended.
- There's a simple javascript/html web app, live here: http://alfalfascout.com/ninesquares/

What could be done:

- A Native Mac GUI (Objective-C? PyObjC?)
- A Native Windows GUI (C# over Python? C++ rewrite?)
- A Native Linux GUI (Python, probably)
