# NineSquares
A nine button game where the goal is to activate all the buttons, but each button may also toggle others.

What's already done:
The command line script runs as intended. You can play it to get a feel for how the game itself works.

What needs doing:
A Mac GUI
- Ideally, do this first.
- The interface should have a "board" of 9 buttons to play the game, a text field to tell the player if they won, and a button to reset the game board.

A Windows GUI
- Ideally, do this second. 

What else could be done:

A Web App
- Javascript + HTML? A Java applet?

A Linux GUI
- To do when a linux os computer is available
